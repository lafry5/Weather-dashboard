Description:
    This code will provide the weather lookout for a city provided by the user. The user will not only be able to see today's weather outlook (temperature, humidity, wind, UV and overall weather icon), but will also see a five-day forecast for the same city. If the user selects another city for a forecast, the previous city will persist in the list below the search field. If the user wants to go back and see the forecast for a city he/she previously search, then he/she simply needs to click the city in the list below the search field and the forecast will re-appear.
